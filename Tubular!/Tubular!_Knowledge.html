<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>To open Tubular! extract the .zip file then enter the folder once 
you're in the folder click the "game" folder from there click the folder
 corresponding to your platform click the "Tubular [the version the game
 you dowloaded] (Open me in FireFox).html" and open it in a browser any 
browser that supports html5 should work however the game was created 
with FireFox in mind so you may run into bugs that may not happen while 
using FireFox, once you're in the game look to the top left of your 
screen then hover over the script button, while your mouse is on the 
script icon click the "1" key, once you've done that locate 
"testinggrounds.pms" now click the "click me" button now you should have
 so ground to stand on!</p>

<h1>Controls</h1>
<p>You may have noticed when you clicked the click me button it moved 
you camera, this is intentional as the this script is supposed to behave
 as a tutorial to move your camera back to your character use the scroll
 wheel (if you don't have a mouse you can use the arrow keys) once your 
camera is back to your character you can use the WASD keys to move your 
character around you can also press and hold [H] key to open the 
console.</p>

<h1>Profile Creation</h1>
<p>Look back up at the top left corner of your screen, now hover over 
the profile button from there press 1 to begin profile creation you will
 first be prompted to chose a numbric colour (0 - 100) for your torso 
after that you should be asked to chose a colour for your other limbs 
then you should be prompted to enter the id for your hat you can find 
the hat ids in the Catalog rinse and repeat until it prompts you to give
 your self a name your name does not have to be unique after that you'll
 have to give yourself an id so scripts and servers can identify you 
this id has to be unique do not give yourself an id thats easy to guess 
and do not share it also make sure to write it down somewhere if you 
want to make changes to your profile in the future, after that you can 
manage your profile data by going back up to the profile button then go 
down to the "?profiledata" list and right clicking it.</p>

<h1>How To Create Scripts</h1>
<p>Open up https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html in a new tab once 
you're there delete the default sprite go the "extensions" tab locate 
"Physics" by griffpatch, click it then make a comment in the backdrop 
containing the following text: <br><br><br><br>

hand. This comment can be deleted to remove the stored settings.
{"framerate":60,"runtimeOptions":
{"maxClones":Infinity,"miscLimits":false,"fencing":false},"hq":false} //

<br><br><br><br>
